Set in the city’s spoken-word scene, “Love Jones” showcased a different aspect of black life, one where struggle and strife did not dictate one’s circumstances, where one’s group of friends, played by Isaiah Washington, Lisa Nicole Carson, Bill Bellamy and Leonard Roberts, were more like family. \n \nIt was the kind of film that white communities had known well. \n \nIn the 20 years since “Love Jones” was released on March 14, 1997, black love has found its way into films and television shows. Think “The Best Man” franchise, “Queen Sugar,” “Southside With You” and “Insecure,” to name a few. But where “Love Jones” should have been a catalyst, a more robust canon of romantic films featuring black couples hasn’t fully materialized. \n \nOn the film’s 20th anniversary, which saw the film honored at last month’s American Black Film Festival Awards, The Times shaped this oral history from conversations with the “Love Jones” cast and crew about how the film came to be, the impact of black love on screen in the 1990s and why the film is considered a classic. \n \n“Love Jones,” at its core, is about possibilities, those opportunities people of color know exist for them — in love, life and career. But it was difficult for Witcher as a first-time director to show those possibilities, especially when most black films on theater marquees at the time were more like “Menace II Society” and “Boyz N the Hood.” Hollywood wanted to make money, and it wasn’t clear that a black romantic drama could do that."

Clocking in at 68 minutes, the film concerns “The Tramp” looking after an abandoned child as events unfold that put his care in jeopardy. The movie is widely considered one of the greatest films in cinema history. The Kid was one of the first films to combine elements of comedy and drama in the same motion picture. It achieved instant success and became the second-highest grossing movie of 1921.\nWhile comedic, the film also delivered a strong social message. The depiction of poverty was influenced directly by Chaplin’s own childhood in London. His family had no means of income, and Chaplin was sent to a workhouse at only seven years old. At the age of 10, Charlie and his brother were forced to fend for themselves after their mother was committed to an asylum for her ongoing battle with mental illness and the early death of their father. This realistic depiction of poverty was masterfully blended with moments of slapstick comedy, giving audiences a real emotional reaction to the characters and their situation. Many believe the relationship between “The Tramp” and “The Child” was in fact influenced by the death of Chaplin’s infant son shortly before production on the film began.\nAs the opening credits of the film begin, the preface states on screen, “A picture with a smile–and perhaps, a tear.” The Kid sums up Chaplin’s artistic intent well, to be inventive and stretch the limits of comedy, all while making audiences feel and think."
